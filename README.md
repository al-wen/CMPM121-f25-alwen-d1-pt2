This project is a incrementer that includes multiple upgrades. The project consists of clicking a button with a clown emoji. Upgrades are all clown themed, and will increaase the number of clowns per second. Theres exists a unique upgrade that doubles the rate of clowns per second.

Inspired by [ThatGuyIain's incrementer — centering trick](https://github.com/ThatGuyIain/cmpm-121-incremental-game/tree/main) for centering the game.

Inspired by [benho612's incrementer — bigger clicker button](https://github.com/benho612/CMPM1212-D1-Assignement) for the bigger clicker button.
